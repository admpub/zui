# Global Style

## Normalize.css

ZUI uses [normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to reset styles, so it is the same in all browsers.

The browser will render the HTML file in the default style, making it easier to read the text and distinguish different content in the file, if an HTML file with no style set is open in an browser.

The default style in the browser will interfere in the style when choosing other styles. Besides, the default styles in different browsers are different, which makes the final rendering of the style chosen is out of control.
